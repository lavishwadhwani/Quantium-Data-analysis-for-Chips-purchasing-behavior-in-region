# Background
Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customerâ€™s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful based on metrics such as
- Who spends the most on chips (total sales), describing customers by lifestage and how premium their general purchasing behaviour is
- How many customers are in each segment
- How many chips are bought per customer by segment
- What's the average chip price by customer segment

# Task
In this project, I have done data merging, data cleaning and data analysis using Excel and SQL as well as data visualisation with a dashboard in PowerBI. All the files are provided including raw datasets, the final dataset and finally a pdf document which contains SQL code and an explanation of the analytical process.
In this project the key analytics skills learnt are:

- Data wrangling
- Data visualization
- Programming skills
- Statistics
- Critical thinking
- Commercial thinking
