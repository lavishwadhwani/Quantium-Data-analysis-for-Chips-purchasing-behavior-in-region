Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customerâ€™s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful. 

In this project the key analytics skills learnt are:

Data wrangling
Data visualization
